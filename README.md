# Behaviorial Cloning Project

This project is part of Deep Learning module of Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree. Here we mimic human driving behavior on a particular track by first running a car on simulator saving steering angles decided by human player. Then use this data to create a virtual self driving car.
